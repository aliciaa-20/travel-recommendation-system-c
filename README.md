# Travel Destination Recommendation System (C)

A console-based travel recommendation system built using a Binary Decision Tree in C.

The program interacts with users through a series of questions (climate, group type, activities) and provides personalized travel destination suggestions using tree traversal.

## Features
- Binary decision tree based recommendation engine
- Recursive traversal logic
- Dynamic memory allocation using structs & pointers
- Interactive CLI experience
- Multiple travel scenarios supported

## Tech Stack
- C Programming
- Data Structures (Binary Trees)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Memory Allocation

## How to Run
gcc main.c -o travel
./travel

## Learning Outcomes
- Tree data structures
- Recursive algorithms
- Pointer-based memory management
- Decision system modeling
